# Red-Wine-Quality-Analysis
Welcome to my Red Wine Analysis project!

Motivation
This si a personal project to help practice my Python data analysis skills. While I was on a working holiday in Europe, I have often come arcoss sitting in a restaurant wondering the difference of wines at different price points. I figured playing with this dataset will help proivding me some insights of different quality red wines.
